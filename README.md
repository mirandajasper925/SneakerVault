About
SneakerVault is a multi-page website for sneaker enthusiasts. It provides the latest news on trending sneakers, showcases top picks, and allows users to explore sneakers by brand. Users can easily filter and search for their favorite brands, making it simple to find information about the sneakers they love.
I’m exploring HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, and since I love sneakers, I decided to combine my passion with learning by creating this website for our midterm, but I count it as my first project. This project allows me to improve my web development skills while building a platform for sneaker fans to stay updated with trends, discover new releases, and explore brands in a user-friendly environment.
